# Introduction to DevOps
## Problem Space

🧐 Imagine you are writing code for a project idea you have yourself. As your project begins to grow, you hire more developers.


**Challenge:** With new developers on board, miscommunication and bottlenecks in deploying updates start to emerge. The cohesive understanding of the project diminishes.


> As your product grows, along with your development team, the need for scalable systems intensifies. Retrofitting scalability into a codebase not originally designed for growth can lead to considerable challenges, necessitating potentially extensive revisions. Therefore, it's crucial to **incorporate scalability from the beginning**, ensuring that your product's success leads directly to improved performance and user satisfaction, rather than technical debt and operational difficulties.

## Typical Division of Development and Operations Roles

In many companies, Development and Operations teams work independently, leading to distinct responsibilities:

| Development Team                                  | Operations Team                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| - Focuses on rapid innovation and sprint-based feature development. | - Responsible for server infrastructure management and release deployments. |
| - Delivers completed code to Operations, often without extensive deployment discussions. | - Addresses integration challenges and clarifies requirements due to environment discrepancies. |
