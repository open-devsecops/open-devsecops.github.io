## Learning Objectives
- Establish a VPN connection to access the corporate internal network.
- Use internal services to generate temporary AWS IAM credentials.
- Authenticate and push Docker images to a company-shared AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
- Demonstrate understanding of AWS IAM roles and permissions by using an assumed role for Docker operations.

## Introduction
This lab simulates a common industry practice where developers need to access corporate resources securely via a VPN. You'll will be using the internal services available to generate temporary credentials for AWS services, allowing you to push Docker images to a company-shared AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

## Accessing the Corporate Network via VPN
> This lab requires the lab infrastructure to be set up by an instructor or administrator. Independent learners should refer to the [lab setup repository](https://github.com/open-devsecops/lab-infra-setup/tree/main/topic-2-devops-lab/aws) to configure this environment accordingly.

**VPN Configuration and Connection:**
- Download the VPN configuration file from `https://{public_ip}`. Ask the lab administrator for the public ip of the internal network, and replace the `{public_ip}` placeholder.
- Import the VPN configuration file into the Wireguard Client to establish the VPN connection. This step provides access to internal services.

**Navigate to the Dashboard:**
- With the VPN connection established, access `http://dashboard.internal` on your browser. This internal service dashboard is your gateway to various corporate resources.

## Generating Temporary AWS IAM Credentials

**Credential Generation:**
- On the dashboard, use the credential generator for the StudentRole AWS IAM role. This utility provides you with temporary credentials granting limited access to AWS services.
- Note down the generated Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and Session Token.

**Configure AWS CLI with Temporary Credentials:**
- Run `aws configure` to input the temporary credentials. When prompted, enter the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and specify the default region `us-west-1`. For the output format, you can choose `json`.
- To use the Session Token, you'll need to export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<your_session_token>
```

## Interacting with AWS ECR
AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a managed Docker container registry service that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

**Check for an Existing Repository:**
In AWS ECR, each Docker image is stored in a repository, which acts as a collection or a namespace for your Docker images. Before pushing a new image to ECR, it's important to check if the respository already exists.

```bash
aws ecr describe-repositories
```

**Create image repository if it doesn't exist:**
```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name <repository-name>
```

**Authenticate Docker Client to AWS ECR:**
- Authenticate your Docker client to the AWS ECR service to enable pushing and pulling images.
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <shared-registry-url>
```
- `<shared-registry-url>` can be found in the internal dashboard.

**Tag and Push Your Docker Image:**
- Tag your local Docker image with the ECR repository URI
```bash
docker tag my-app <shared-registry-url>/<repository-name>
```
- After tagging, push your Docker image to the AWS ECR repository
```bash
docker push <shared-registry-url>/<repository-name>
```

## Managing Docker Images Locally and Pulling from AWS ECR
Okay, let's now verify that you can pull the image from the remote registry. We'll do this by deleting images to simulate a fresh environment, and pulling the image from AWS ECR to demonstrate accessibility.

```bash
docker images
```

This command lists all Docker images stored locally. If you've been following along with this lab, you should see at least two images:
- The original image you built from your Dockerfile.
- The tagged image intended for AWS ECR.

**Deleting the local Docker images:**
```bash
docker rmi <image-name>
docker rmi <shared-registry-url>/<repository-name>
```

**Pulling the Docker Image from AWS ECR:**
After cleaning up local images, we can demonstrate that any machine with appropriate IAM credentials can pull the Docker image from AWS ECR:
```bash
docker pull <shared-registry-url>/<repository-name>
```
