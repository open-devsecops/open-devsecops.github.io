## Introduction
This lab introduces the concepts of containerization with Docker and the use of AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) as a shared container registry. You'll gain hands-on experience by containerizing a React application and pushing the container image to a shared registry. This exercise is crucial for understanding how applications are packaged and distributed in a DevSecOps workflow.
