## Introduction
In Chapter 1, we explored the fundamentals of containerization and how to manually build and push Docker images to a shared container registry - AWS ECR. This manual process, however, introduces potential for human error.

Transitioning from these manual workflows, Chapter 2 aims to streamline and automate these processes through the introduction of a basic CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. By automating builds, tests, and deployments, we can significantly reduce the risk of errors, ensure consistency across environments, and accelerate the delivery of software updates.
